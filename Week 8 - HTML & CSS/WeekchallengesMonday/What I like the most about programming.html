<title>What I like about programming</title>
<body>

<h1>Baby steps into coding</h1>

<p>What I like the most about programming is that it helps you to think about more options and solutions not only by 
checking bugs, but also gives you a wider perspective of how to deal with problems. Remote work is also a great perk and my interest is web development
I would love to create beautiful websites and get creative with them, the visual aspect of coding is what makes it beautiful. 
Learning how to code is hard, but as with everything, practice will allow you to master this great skill and of course never stop learning.
