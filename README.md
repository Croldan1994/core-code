2) Java language is compiled or interpreted?
R: Java is a mixture of compiled and interpreted language. The main reason for this is the source code has to be compiled into byte-code and then the JVM (Java Virtual Machin) will then interpret the code into machine code and it will have the ability to be used on any platform or operative system. 

3) Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currency to USD
R:
1. Browse the internet and use google or any other search engine on my mobile device or laptop 
2. Type "Currency converter" on the navigation bar
3. The search engine will display the options, so I will just select a website that converts currencies
4. Define the input currency to be in quetzales
5. Define the output currency to be in USD
6. Make the calculus and get the output in the USD currency

4) Why is pseudocode helpful? 
R: It is helpful because it allows the programmer to understand what the issue is, it allows a programmer to describe the issue in a away it can be understood and then once the problem has been identified, it will be easier to know what functions, conditional statements and syntax to use to solve that problem and translate it into code. 

5 )Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022)

R:  

1. The user must enter the year of birth
2. The output will be the age of the user. 
3. Define a variable that allows the user to know his age based on his date of birth

     If the user enters his year of birth the output will be the the substraction of 2022 minus the year of birth
     
     
6) Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?

Flowcharts are important because they will allow us to have a structure and a set of steps that our algorithm should take by making it easier to read and understanding when we want to create our code.
